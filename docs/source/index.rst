SQL-Server Anomaly Detection Service
====================================

SQL Server Anomaly Detection Service is an open source software library
for anomaly detection service utilizing state-of-the-art machine
learning techniques. It is developed by DATA lab at Texas A&M
University. The goal of SQLServerAD is to provide anomaly detection
services which meets the demands for users in different fields, w/wo
data science or machine learning background. SQLServerAD gives the
ability to execute machine learning algorithms in-database without
moving data outside SQL Server or over the network.

SQL-Server Anomaly Detection Service is featured for:

-  **Full Stack Service** which supports operations and maintenances
   from light-weight SQL based database to back-end machine learning
   algorithms and makes the throughput speed faster;

-  **State-of-the-art Anomaly Detection Approaches** including
   **Statistical/Machine Learning/Deep Learning** models with unified
   APIs and detailed documentation;

-  **Powerful Data Analysis Mechanism** which supports both **static and
   time-series data** analysis with flexible time-slice(sliding-window)
   segmentation.
